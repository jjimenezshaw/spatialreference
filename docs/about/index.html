        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>spatialreference.org is a website by <a href="https://hobu.co/">Howard Butler</a>,
        <a href="https://crschmidt.net/">Christopher Schmidt</a>,  <a href="http://dbsgeo.com/">Dane Springmeyer</a> and
        <a href="http://porcupinealley.com/">Josh Livni</a>
        that helps assist others in their understanding, recording, and usage of spatial reference systems.
        It was updated in 2023 by <a href="https://javier.jimenezshaw.com/">Javier Jimenez Shaw</a>
        to be based on <a href="https://proj.org/">PROJ.org</a> and it is now managed by the PROJ development team.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>

        <p>While this site is coincidentally somewhat educational and fun to surf around in :), its real purpose is to allow
        you to use URL/URI-based references to spatial reference systems.  You might think of it as a neogeo
        approach to a very oldgeo problem -- universally describing coordinate systems.  However, rather than
        attempting to come up with yet another description and encoding scheme that few would use and would
        incompletely solve the problem, we've taken a slightly different approach.  Instead, the expectation of
        spatialreference.org is to attempt to provide spatial reference descriptions in as many formats as possible, a
        sort of  web-based <a href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a> for spatial references (by the way, GDAL
        and <a href="http://proj.maptools.org/">Proj.4</a> are the backbone of this website).
        </p>
        <p>
        This approach allows you to refer to a URL that can produce a spatial reference in a format that your
        software can use.
        </p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
        There are currently three distinct catalogs of spatial reference systems on this website -- EPSG, ESRI, and
        User-defined (called sr-org).  Others, like Oracle and ICU should be forthcoming.
        </p>
